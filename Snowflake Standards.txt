Tables:
	* Staging tables:
		• All staging tabels should be Transient.
	
	* Prod Tables:
		• All production tables should be permanent.
		• While creating tables give proper datatypes.
		• Always run updates on staging tables before pushing data to prod tables.

Database:
	* Development:
		• Should be transient
	* Staging:
		• Should be transient
	* Prod:
		• Should be permanent 
	* Datamart:
		• Should be permanent 
		
		
Data Loading:
	• While loading data to a table, sort by keys on which you want to query data in future ( Joins, Filter predicates )

		
Warehouse:
	• While executing queries always use column names instead of using `*`. If you want to use `*` use limit clause along with it.
	
	
Data retention & Time travel:
	• Set retention period of stage tables to 0.
	• For production tables set retention period to max.
	• Set retention period to 0 for cloned database for analytics.
